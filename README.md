🧠 People Analytics Dashboard — Workforce Intelligence for HR Leadership
📌 Project Overview

This project simulates the role of a People / HR Data Analyst responsible for transforming raw employee data into actionable insights for HR leadership.

The goal was to design an end-to-end analytics solution to help HR teams:

Monitor workforce health

Identify drivers of employee attrition

Analyze compensation and performance trends

Support workforce planning and decision-making

The solution combines MySQL + Power BI + DAX to create an executive-ready HR analytics dashboard.

Limited leadership visibility

This project demonstrates how a centralized analytics dashboard can solve these problems.
